Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your new iPhone. We'd like to show you around.

To start, turn on your iPhone by pressing and holding the On/Off button for a few seconds. Then follow the onscreen instructions to set up your iPhone.

Button basics
To turn off or restart iPhone, press and hold the On/Off button for a few seconds, then drag the slider to confirm. To turn off the screen but still receive calls, press On/Off once. Press the Home button at any time to return to the Home screen. To quickly switch between recently used apps, double-click the Home button and tap an app icon.

Phone
Tap a phone number in Contacts, Favorites, an email, a text message, or almost anywhere in iPhone to make a call. Or dial with the keypad in the Phone app. Press the On/Off button once to slience an incoming call or twice to send it directly to voicemail. Or slide the Phone button up to reply with a text message or set up a reminder to call back. To answer a call while using the iPhone headset, press the center button once. Press it again to end your call.
