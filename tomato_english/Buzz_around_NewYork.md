### 正文

女主：It is so good to see you guys! Although it is like three in the morning in California right now. I just landed, and got here.

朋友：This is Emily(埃米莉，女子名).

女主：Emily, good to meet you. Hi. I'm still Claudia, and excited, super excited. Rachel, Patrick, all my good friends. Alright, so, what are we doing today? Although I'm super **jet-lagged**, and super (tired).

MISSION CARD

女主：What did I just say? OK, So, it says please find the Airbnb we booked. following the hints below. OK. It's good that at least we've booked somewhere to stay. 14th Street. We are on 14th, but maybe it's a cross. We can look at, maybe what the number is. Let's walk down here a little bit. Come on, Patrick. I don't wanna lose you on the first day. Let's go.

旁边：That's right. Our trip to New York has officially begun! Claudia is now going to look for **the guest house**. we booked on Airbnb. For many people, staying in guest houses while traveling can present a lot of problems. You might have a lot of questions to ask the owner, but just don't know how to ask. Worry not. Today we're going to have a look at what checking into a guest house in New York is like!

女主：Dear audience, I have a question for you actually. Do you know what those stairs outside the buildings are for? Actually it is because a horrifying fire incident happened in 1911 when 146 workers actually lost their lives through a horrible fire. So now it is mandatory(强制的) in New York law that you have **fire escape ladders** outside the buildings.

女主：**I think we are actually almost there.** And it says to look for a blue lockbox at Beyond Sushi. Oh, is this Beyond Sushi? Okay, Can you imagine how many people has(have) touched this? Yeah! This is like treasure hunt. (拿到钥匙)

女主：Check this out. They do not have elevators, apparently. Alright, This is what teaching English entails --- heavy lifting. Yeah, alright, we got it. Oh.(进入房间)

女主：Wow. Pretty nice. How much did you pay for this place? It's Manhattan, must be expensive. Is it a lot? A lot? Let me actually look up how much it would be to own a place like this. I imagine that it'll be hell a lot, as we would say in California. Manhattan East Village. Oh, my God. Can you guess how much it is so actually own a place in the East Village in New York? So it is about 14200 something per square meter(s). Although we don't use square meters, we use square feet. But, that's a lot of money.

女主：I don't...I don't think they have (a) laundry here. Did you notice? I don't think they have (a) laundry on-site. Right? No. I didn't see any... I might be able to call the owner, and ask if they have one in the building. And then (if) you guys have a few other questions, I might as well just ask right now too. Let me call him. (准备给房东打电话)

女主：I'll put him on speakerphone so you guys...

房东：Hello ?

女主：Hi, Jonty

房东：Hi, speaking.

女主：Hi, this is Claudia. I'm your Airbnb person.

房东：Hi there, how is it going?

女主：Hi, we just got here earlier today. and **I'm actually calling with a few questions.**

房东：Sure.

女主：Yeah, actually gorgeous please. I... I love this place. **Thank you so much for having us.**

房东：Oh, absolutely.

女主：So I was gonna ask, um, is there (a) laundry on-site for this building?

房东：So there isn't (a) laundry on-site, there is a laundry that's a few blocks away, um, on 3rd Avenue.

女主：**Is it a coin operated laundry place, or is it like a dry cleaning place?**

房东：I think it's ... it's coin operated, but I think you could... if you want it, you could **drop your stuff off** and then come back. And then they'll do it for you.

女主：Ah, I see. We were hoping to open a little...crack a little window at night to get some fresh air. **Would it be not safe, or would it be okay?** 

房东：Oh no, totally safe.

女主：OK, sounds good. And, while... while you're still here, I was gonna ask, um, do we, **do you have any recommendation for this area for a quick bite?** 

房东：Oh yeah, absolutely. Um, Joe's Pizza. I believe it's... it will be third and... and 14th?Yeah, right there.

女主：**Any tourist traps**... that you... you would think we should avoid?

房东：I would... Yeah, I would avoid... Okay, so if you check out Times Square to see it, like have a look... but like I wouldn't do... I wouldn't buy any food. Well, I wouldn't... Don't do the bus. Don't do one of those tourist bus(es). Yeah I see people on them all the time, like be this, deep in the traffic.

女主：That's... that's good advice. It's being perfect. Thank you so much for your help. Very helpful host.

女主：Oh, I'm gonna need some rest before I start doing another mission. So do not hand me anything red. I do not want to see it.

旁边：Alright, alright, we'll let you rest for a bit. This was just our first day in New York. Claudia successfully found our guest house, chatted up the landlord, and is now comfortably off to sleep. Is this the end of today's story? Nope, next we've prepared a very important review section for you. Be sure to work hard on it.
